# CSC1008 Data Structures and Algorithm (Final Project)
Lyft Ride Hailing App

## Objectives
Design and implement an on-demand transportation application that enables users to request private and shared rides.

## How to run
- git clone entire repository to your local drive/ cloud drive
- make sure venv module is installed if not install by typing in cmd ```pip install venv```
- open a new virtual env folder by typing in cmd in project directory ```python -m venv venv```, this will create a venv folder which you can use to activate the virtual env script
- activate the virtual env script by typing in cmd in project directory ```venv\Scripts\Activate```
- recursively install the pre-requisite packages by typing in cmd ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- run the program by typing in cmd in project directory ```python app.py```, this will install the nlpt packages on your local computer in order to run the chatbot

## Features
- account features (sign in. sign out, create account)
- shortest pathing among pre-designated nodes
- able to demo for private rides, as well as shared rides
- demonstrate use of graph structures
- drivers to pax matching using heuristic algorithm
- random drivers visualization
